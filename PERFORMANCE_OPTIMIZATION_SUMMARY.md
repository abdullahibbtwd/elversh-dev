- Bundle Size: ~500KB (estimated)

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Image Optimization
- **WebP conversion**: Convert all images to WebP format
- **Responsive images**: Implement proper srcset for different screen sizes
- **CDN implementation**: Use a CDN for faster image delivery
- **Lazy loading**: Implement lazy loading for non-critical images

### 2. Font Optimization
- **Font display**: Add `font-display: swap` to all fonts
- **Preload critical fonts**: Preload only essential fonts
- **Subset fonts**: Use font subsets to reduce file sizes

### 3. Code Splitting
- **Route-based splitting**: Split code by routes
- **Component splitting**: Lazy load heavy components
- **Dynamic imports**: Use dynamic imports for non-critical features

### 4. Caching Strategy
- **Service Worker**: Implement comprehensive caching strategy
- **Browser caching**: Optimize cache headers
- **CDN caching**: Use CDN for static assets

### 5. Server Optimization
- **Database queries**: Optimize Convex queries
- **Response time**: Improve server response time
- **Edge caching**: Implement edge caching for global performance

## Monitoring and Testing

### Tools to Use
1. **Lighthouse**: Run regular audits

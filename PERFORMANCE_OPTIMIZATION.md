# Performance Optimization Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented to improve the Real Experience Score (RES) from 54 to target 90+.

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Bundle Size Reduction
- **Removed heavy dependencies**: Eliminated Three.js, React Three Fiber, and OGL
- **Optimized imports**: Used dynamic imports for GSAP animations
- **Package optimization**: Configured Next.js to optimize package imports

### 2. Image Optimization
- **Next.js Image component**: Implemented proper image optimization
- **WebP/AVIF formats**: Added support for modern image formats
- **Blur placeholders**: Added loading placeholders for better perceived performance
- **Priority loading**: Critical images load with priority

### 3. Animation Optimization
- **Lazy loading**: GSAP animations load only when needed
- **Reduced complexity**: Simplified animation timelines and reduced blob animations
- **Progressive enhancement**: Animations don't block initial content rendering

### 4. Loading Strategy
- **Global loader optimization**: Reduced blocking time with smart fade-out
- **Lazy component loading**: Non-critical components load on demand
- **Intersection Observer**: Components load when they come into view

### 5. Caching Strategy
- **Service Worker**: Implemented for offline support and caching
- **DNS prefetching**: Pre-resolve external domains
- **Resource preloading**: Critical resources preloaded

### 6. Core Web Vitals Optimization
- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)**: Optimized hero image loading
- **FID (First Input Delay)**: Reduced JavaScript execution time
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)**: Fixed layout shifts with proper image sizing
- **FCP (First Contentful Paint)**: Faster initial content rendering

### 7. Network Optimization
- **Compression**: Enabled gzip compression
- **Minification**: SWC minification for faster builds
- **Tree shaking**: Removed unused code

## Performance Monitoring

### Core Web Vitals Tracking
- LCP: Target < 2.5s
- FID: Target < 100ms
- CLS: Target < 0.1
- FCP: Target < 1.8s

### Tools Used
- Vercel Speed Insights
- Performance Monitor component
- Browser DevTools Performance tab

## Expected Improvements

### Before Optimization
- Real Experience Score: 54
- First Contentful Paint: 5.01s
- Largest Contentful Paint: 8.08s
- Interaction to Next Paint: 216ms

### After Optimization (Expected)
- Real Experience Score: 90+
- First Contentful Paint: < 1.8s
- Largest Contentful Paint: < 2.5s
- Interaction to Next Paint: < 100ms

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. CDN Implementation
- Consider using a CDN for static assets
- Implement edge caching for better global performance

### 2. Database Optimization
- Optimize Convex queries for faster data fetching
- Implement query caching where appropriate

### 3. Code Splitting
- Further split components by routes
- Implement dynamic imports for heavy features

### 4. Monitoring
- Set up real user monitoring (RUM)
- Implement error tracking and performance alerts

## Testing Performance

### Local Testing
```bash
# Build and analyze bundle
npm run analyze

# Run performance audit
npm run build
npm run start
```

### Production Testing
- Use Lighthouse CI for automated testing
- Monitor Core Web Vitals in Google Search Console
- Track performance metrics in Vercel Analytics

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Monitor bundle size weekly
- Review and update dependencies monthly
- Analyze performance metrics quarterly
- Update service worker cache version as needed

### Performance Budget
- Total bundle size: < 500KB
- Initial JavaScript: < 200KB
- CSS: < 50KB
- Images: Optimize to < 100KB each

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **High LCP**: Check image optimization and loading strategy
2. **High FID**: Reduce JavaScript execution time
3. **High CLS**: Fix layout shifts with proper sizing
4. **Slow FCP**: Optimize critical rendering path

### Debug Tools
- Chrome DevTools Performance tab
- Lighthouse audits
- WebPageTest for detailed analysis
- Vercel Speed Insights for real-world data
